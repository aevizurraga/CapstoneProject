          Fishmeal is a product that is used to feed farm animals and some marine animals, mainly made from anchovies or
          other small fish. It's popularity around the world is due to high levels of protein and availability. For
          years now, Peru is the leading country in the production and exportation of fishmeal. In the fishing industry,
          fish are caught for two distinct purposes, direct human consumption (canned, frozen, fresh) or for indirect
          human consumption (fishmeal, fish oil). About 83% of all fish caught in Peru in 2008 were for indirect human
          consumption totaling in more than 6 million metric tons. The majority of fishmeal production comes from
          Chimbote, a city north of Lima with the biggest port in the world. Although the fishmeal industry has created
          jobs for many people and contributes millions of dollars to the Peruvian economy, it also has negative
          drawbacks. Due to the many factories that have been built around the city, residents of Chimbote have seen
          increased levels of pollution. Once a tourist attraction, the beaches are now filled with garbage and tainted
          water. If the fishmeal industry wants to survive, it must learn to adapt to a changing world.

          Located in South America and known for its cuisine, culture, and for being one of the most popular tourist
          destinations in the world is Peru. Peru has access to about 1,500 miles of Pacific Ocean coastline, a popular
          choice for the fishing industry. While this story will focus on the Peruvian anchoveta, or anchovy, there are
          many other species of fish that also live in these waters such as tuna, mackerel, and the hake, a cod-like
          fish. These are all important to note as they are used for the direct consumption of humans, a topic talked
          about later in this story.

          Chimbote is a small fishing city, located in the district of Santa, about 250 miles north of Peru's capital,
          Lima. Although Chimbote is a small fishing city, it is one of the main producers of fishmeal in Peru as well
          as considered the world's biggest fishing port. Altering Chimbote during the 20th century, the fishmeal
          industry converted a small tourist town of 30,000 people to a working-class city of nearly 265,100.
          While some see the fishmeal industry as an advantage, most inhabitants do not agree. Fishmeal producing
          factories have polluted not just residential air but also oceans. The strength of the fishmeal industry in
          Chimbote has silenced many residents who want more positive changes for their city. The industry has the power
          to shut down any person or organization that attempts to fight for the Chimbote residents or the environment.

          The large population of the native Peruvian anchoveta makes Peru the world’s largest exporter in fishmeal. Its
          "boom" started in the mid 60’s. In 1967, more than 2 million tons of fishmeal were exported globally. However,
          the industry and exportation has been impacted throughout the years by the effects of climate change, such as
          "El Niño”, a naturally occurring phenomenon whose magnitude is affected by man-made climate change. In 1972, a
          year when Peru was struck by an "El Niño", only around 350,000 tons of fishmeal were exported.<br><br>
          Even with all the issues that are capable of affecting the industry, it has still been able to export vast
          amounts of fishmeal to the world. It is estimated that in 2021, Peru will have exported about 1,100,000 metric
          tons of fishmeal globally. The next closest nation, Chile, is estimated to export only about 210,000 metric
          tons. Although this may seem as a positive for Peru, the fishmeal industry has had a great negative societal
          and environmental impact to the country.

          One of the main negative impacts of fishmeal production on the environment is the waste of water. It is
          estimated that to transport 1 ton of fishmeal to the factories, about two to three tons of water is needed.
          During use, water is contaminated and cannot be used any longer.<br><br>
          In 2005, Peru removed from the ocean about 8,628,000 tons of anchovies for the indirect consumption of humans.
          If we estimate how much water was wasted to transport the anchovies to the factories, it totals to about 17 to
          24 million tons.<br><br>
          The visualization on the right displays the amount of water needed to transport the anchovies to fishmeal
          producing factories. At a time where it is estimated that about 77 million people in South America lack access
          to potable water, these wasted resources should be put into better use. In Ancash, where Chimbote is located,
          only about 80% of residents have access to clean drinking water.

          Overfishing is defined as “the removal of a species of fish from a body of water at a rate that the species
          cannot replenish, resulting in those species becoming underpopulated in that area.” The Peruvian anchovy has
          been fished at high rates from the Peruvian ocean, resulting in negative consequences. In 2017, the high
          presence of juvenile anchovies, anchovies that are too small to be fished, caused the Peruvian government to
          close the fishing season prematurely. Juvenile anchovies are protected to maintain the anchovy population in
          Peru’s ocean. The high presence of these is a sign they are being fished from at high rates. The anchovies
          must be allowed to mature to maintain a healthy quantity in the ecosystem.<br><br>
          The overfishing of anchovies has also damaged the populations of other species surrounding Peruvian waters.
          South American sea lions, also known as lobos marinos chuscos, are predators of the Peruvian anchoveta.
          Because they need anchovies to survive, the disappearance of the fish could be catastrophic for this sea lion
          species. There is already a proven correlation between the anchovy population and the South American sea lion
          population in Peru. When the quantity of anchovies decreased, the sea lion population also decreased.<br><br>
          Birds that live near the coast of Peru will also be harmed by the great removal of anchovies. There are
          certain species that heavily depend on the fish for nutrition. Guano birds, such as cormorants, gannets and
          pelicans, are the main predators of anchovies. They are very beneficial to our environment as they are
          producers of guano, which can be used as natural fertilizer. To analyze the need for anchovies of any
          predator, we could look at their diet. If a certain species only eats anchovies, then anchovies will account
          for 100% of their diet. For cormorants, anchovies make up about 95% of their diet. For gannets and pelicans,
          it is about 80%.

          Employment is a sector that could be greatly improved by the reduction the fishmeal industry. The chart to the
          left shows that the quantities of fishmeal that are exported do not have an impact on the income of the people
          living in these areas. While the average monthly income for Ancash, where Chimbote is located, has increased
          consistently with Peru's average, the amount of fishmeal exported has varied greatly during those
          years.<br><br>
          The strong variations of fishmeal exported each year also affect fishermen and factory workers. As seen below,
          the quantities of fishmeal that are exported have been greatly impacted by natural disasters and quotas
          imposed by the Peruvian government, influencing employment for the people working in these sectors.

          Even with all of these foods available inside the country, there are still countless children and adults that
          suffer from malnutrition. Anchovies, which are high in nutritional value, could be used to address the issue.
          Norway is a nation that also has an abundance of anchovies in their oceans and use the majority of their fish
          landings for the direct consumption of humans. They also have a much lower percentage of population living
          under malnourishment at 2.5%.<br><br>
          The table on the left side displays the amount of fishmeal that is exported from Peru and the percentage of
          the population considered undernourished. There is a pattern that shows a decrease in percentage of
          undernourished people when fishmeal exports decrease. As well as an increase in percentage of undernourished
          people when fishmeal exports increase. While there is not enough evidence to conclude that decreasing the
          amount of fishmeal exported will result in a decrease in the undernourished population, this relationship
          should be studied further.<br><br>
          Almost all of the anchovies caught in Peru are reserved for fishmeal. Since 2013, the proportion of anchovies
          reserved for fishmeal has not been under 96%. For Norway, in 2007, the last year for which the data is
          available, only about 13% of their fish landings are used towards producing fish oil and fishmeal. In fact,
          Peru has a yearly quota on the number of anchovies that can be used for direct human consumption. While there
          have been many proposals to use anchovies to adequately feed its citizens, the Peruvian government has failed
          to implement a plan to use anchovies to reduce the malnourished population.
