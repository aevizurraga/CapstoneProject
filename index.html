            Fishmeal is a product that is used to feed farm animals
            and some marine animals. It is mainly made from anchovies or other small fish.
            It's popularity around the world is due to it's high levels of protein and availability.
            For years now, Peru has led all countries in the production and exportation of fishmeal.
            In the fishing industry, fish are caught for two distinct purposes. They are caught for direct
            human consumption (canned, frozen, fresh) or for indirect human consumption (fishmeal, fish oil).
            About 83% of all fish caught in Peru in 2008 were for indirect human consumption which totaled more
            than 6 million metric tons.[1] The vast majority of fishmeal production comes from Chimbote, a city north of
            Lima
            with the biggest port in the world. Although the fishmeal industry has created jobs for many people and
            contributes millions of dollars to the Peruvian economy, it has had some negative effects. Due to the
            many factories that have been built around the city, residents of Chimbote have seen increased levels of
            pollution.
            Once a tourist attraction, the beaches are now filled with garbage and dirty water. If the fishmeal industry
            wants
            to survive, it must learn to adapt to a changing world.

            Chimbote is a small fishing city, located in the district of Santa. Chimbote is about 250 miles north of
            Peru's capital, Lima. Even though Chimbote is a small fishing city, it is considered the world's biggest
            fishing port, in terms of fish caught. [citation] It is also one of the main producers of fishmeal in Peru.
            The fishmeal industry drastically altered Chimbote during the 20th century. Transforming from a place fo a
            about 30,000 people, visited by tourists due to its beautiful and clean beaches, to a city of about 265,100
            people that largely depends on the fishmeal industry for its income.

            One of the main negative impacts of fishmeal production on the environment is the waste of water. It is
            estimated that to transport 1 ton of fishmeal to the factories, about two to three tons of water is
            needed.This water is then wasted because it is contaminated and cannot be used for anything else. <br><br>
            In 2005, Peru removed from the ocean about 8,628,000 tons of anchovies for the indirect consumption of
            humans. If we estimate how much water was wasted to transport the anchovies to the factories, it comes out
            to about 17 to 24 million tons of water wasted.

            Employment is a sector that could be greatly improved by the reduction of the importance of the fishmeal
            industry. The chart to the left shows that the quantities of fishmeal that is exported does not have an
            impact on the income of the people living in these areas. While the average monthly income for Ancash, the
            department where Chimbote is located, has increased consistently with Peru's average, the amount of fishmeal
            exported has varied greatly during those years. <br><br>
            The strong variations of fishmeal exported each year also affects fishermen and factory workers that produce
            fishmeal. As seen below, the quantities of fishmeal that is exported by Peru has been greatly affected by
            natural disasters and quotas imposed by the Peruvian governemnt, affecting employment for the people working
            in these sectors.

        <div class="malnourishmentInfo">
          <h5>Peru, for years, has dealt with malnourishment. Malnourishment is defined as the "lack of proper
            nutrition, caused by not having enough to eat, not eating enough of the right things, or being unable to use
            the food that one does eat." This might seem odd to some since Peru has one of the worlds best cuisines. It
            is also home to some of the most nutritious grains and vegetables in the world such as potatoes, maca,
            quinoa, and kiwicha.
            <br><br>
            Even with all of these foods available inside the country, there are still countless children and adults
            that suffer from malnutrition. Anchovies, one of the most nutritious fish available in the sea, could be
            used to feed many across Peru. Norway, a nation that also has an abundance of anchovies in their oceans,
            uses the majority of their fish landings for the direct consumption of humans. They also have a much lower
            percentage of population living under malnourishment at 2.5%.
            <br>
            The table on the left side displays the amount of fishmeal that is exported from Peru and the percentage of
            the Peruvian population considered undernouished. There is a pattern that shows a decrease in percentage of
            undernouished people when fishmeal exports decrease. As well as an increase in percentage of undernouished
            people when fishmeal exports increase. While there is not enough evidence to conclude that decreasing the
            amount of fishmeal exported will result in a decrease in the undernourished population, this relationship
            should be studied further.
            <br><br>
            Almost all of the anchovies that are fished out in Peru are reserved for fishmeal. Since 2013, the
            proportion of anchovies reserved for fishmeal does not under 96%. For Norway, in 2007, the last year for
            which the data is available, only about 13% of their fish landings are used towards producing fish oil and
            fishmeal. Peru actually has a yearly quota on the number of anchovies that can be used for direct human
            consumption. While there have been many proposals to use anchovies to adequately feed many people in Peru,
            the Peruvian government has failed to implement a plan to use anchovies to reduce the undernourished
            population.
